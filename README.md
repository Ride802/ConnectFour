# ConnectFour
-------------

### Description
The purpose of this project is to simulate the two-player tabletop game, 'Connect Four'. I built this project to practice using Python, the terminal, and computer science basics.
Using this program, two players are able to play 'Connect Four' in their computer termnial, without having to purchase a physical set.

### Features
Option for two players only (no AI players programmed). 
Option to change player markers (currently set at 'X' and 'O')

### How to Use
The game begins by welcoming you to the program and describes the instructions: Drop markers into columns 1-7 to get four in a row.
You can get 4 in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
A blank 6x7 matrix is displayed with the columns labeled 1 thru 7.
Player 'X' starts the game.
Player 'X' is asked to choose a column 1-7, and an input bar is provided.
After choosing a column, an 'X' marker will be displayed at the lowest **empty** row (highest index) of the chosen column.
Player 'O' is then asked to choose a column 1-7, and an input bar is provided.
After choosing a column, an 'X' marker will be displayed at the lowest **empty** row (highest index) of the chosen column.
Players take turns choosing columns to drop their marker until the matrix is full (tie), or one player drops four sequential markers vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Technologies
Written in python with the core of the code written by GrokAI using the prompt "how would you program a game of connect-four in python that could be played in the terminal"
Additinal comments have been added to explain the code
